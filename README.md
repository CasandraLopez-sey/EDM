### About Me
Hi, Im Casandra Tabuzo Lopez. Currently a college student in City College of Angeles, taking a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. And while I'm presently working on a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems, computers aren't my main interest. I'm here to learn more and investigate new possibilities. Although I'm not yet an expert in computer use or data cleansing, I have a strong desire to learn more and advance in this area. I think I can gain a thorough understanding of the subject and make a significant contribution if I put in the necessary time and effort. I can't wait to take on the challenges that lie ahead and continue my academic career.
